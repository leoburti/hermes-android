## Status snapshot

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Secure WebView shell | Done - HTTPS-only navigation, host allowlist, hardened defaults |
| WebUI integration | Done - first-run URL settings, session persistence, pull-to-refresh |
| Dashboard Terminal route | Done - native drawer destination for configured `/chat` URL |
| Android sharing | Done - share-to-app intake for text and files |
| Files | Done - WebView upload/download integration |
| Local settings | Done - encrypted settings storage |
| Native distribution polish | Partial - app identity exists; package ID and release signing decisions still open |
| Phase 2 native features | Planned - deep links, notifications, biometrics, profiles, camera |

## Forward work

| ID | Priority | Status | Area | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A-005 | P1 | Todo | Deep links | Add deep-link intent filter and route mapping | Include allowlist and route-safety checks |
| A-009 | P1 | Todo | Settings | Add server profile list | Needed before broader multi-host use |
| A-007 | P1 | Todo | Security UX | Add optional biometric app lock gate | Feature-flagged in settings |
| A-006 | P1 | Todo | Notifications | Add FCM plumbing, channels, and click routing | Requires infrastructure decision for push source |
| A-008 | P2 | Todo | Attachments | Add camera capture in file chooser flow | Include permissions and fallback behavior |
| A-010 | P2 | Todo | Tests | Add instrumentation tests for navigation, share, and deep links | Emulator-ready where practical |
| A-011 | P3 | Todo | Release | Add release signing automation docs and snippets | Keep keystore secrets out of repo |
| A-013 | P2 | Todo | Navigation | Add more drawer destinations | Wait for stable WebUI routes for files, kanban, sessions, status |
| A-014 | P1 | Todo | Release | Finalize package ID and namespace | Decide before first public release; current value is `com.hermes.wrapper` |

Recommended next order:

1. A-014 Package ID decision
2. A-005 Deep links
3. A-009 Server profile list
4. A-007 Biometric lock
