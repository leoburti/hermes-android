> Maintenance-focused Android wrapper for Hermes Web UI. The core wrapper is
> good as-is; product UI and workflow changes belong in Hermes WebUI.

## Status snapshot

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Secure WebView shell | Done - HTTP/HTTPS navigation, host allowlist, hardened defaults |
| WebUI integration | Done - first-run WebUI URL setting, WebUI-owned dashboard config, session persistence, pull-to-refresh |
| WebView compatibility | Done - disables forced darkening, patches Android viewport-unit collapse, respects system-bar safe insets, uses browser-managed cache defaults, smooths reload rendering, restores touch-and-hold context-menu dispatch for conversation actions, and forces WebUI microphone input onto the Android-compatible MediaRecorder path |
| Official dashboard link | Done - Android no longer writes WebUI's Official Hermes Dashboard config, opens explicitly configured dashboard-origin requests in a Chrome Custom Tab with minimal browser UI, and avoids persisting dashboard pages as startup state |
| Android sharing | Done - share-to-app intake for text and files |
| Files | Done - WebView upload/download integration |
| Microphone | Done - allowlisted WebView audio capture with Android runtime permission plus WebUI MediaRecorder fallback |
| Local settings | Done - encrypted settings storage |
| Native navigation | Done - WebUI-owned dashboard link integration and deep links |
| Server health probing | Done - `/api/status` probe to distinguish server-down from content errors |
| Browser notifications | Done - WebUI Notification API bridge, Android runtime permission, notification channel, and trusted WebUI tap routing |
| Native distribution polish | Done - app identity and signed release automation are wired for local builds plus GitHub Actions |
| Maintenance posture | Stable - accept Android-wrapper fixes, compatibility updates, dependency updates, and release maintenance |
| Native feature expansion | Deferred - revisit only for Android-specific needs with a clear WebUI/API boundary |

## Feature checklist

### MVP shell

- [x] Secure WebView opens a configured Hermes WebUI URL
- [x] First-run WebUI URL prompt and settings surface
- [x] HTTP/HTTPS URL validation
- [x] Host allowlist for in-app navigation
- [x] External handoff for non-allowlisted HTTP/HTTPS links
- [x] Cleartext traffic permitted for configured HTTP deployments
- [x] Back handling and WebView history behavior
- [x] Pull-to-refresh
- [x] Default WebView HTTP/service-worker cache behavior
- [x] Loading, error, and offline states
- [x] Cookie-backed session persistence
- [x] Encrypted local settings

### Android integration

- [x] File upload support
- [x] File download support
- [x] Microphone capture support for WebUI voice input
- [x] Browser notification permission and delivery bridge for WebUI alerts
- [x] Share-to-app intake for text
- [x] Share-to-app intake for files
- [x] Native launcher identity
- [x] Splash and app theme
- [x] WebUI-owned Official Hermes Dashboard setting
- [x] Official dashboard link route
- [x] Deep links (`hermes://session/{id}`)
- [x] Server health probing
- [ ] Camera capture in file chooser
- [ ] Direct share-file auto-attach flow
- [ ] Attachment progress and retry UX

### Deferred Android-only ideas

These are not active priorities. Revisit only if a specific Android platform
need justifies native work. WebUI layout, styling, animations, and product
workflow changes should be made in Hermes WebUI instead.

- [x] Deep links and verified app links to Hermes routes
- [x] Server health probing to refine offline/error states
- [ ] Server profile list for multiple Hermes hosts
- [ ] Optional biometric app lock before showing WebView
- [ ] FCM push notification plumbing
- [x] Notification channel strategy
- [x] Notification click routing to allowlisted WebUI routes
- [ ] Expanded native settings for theme, notifications, and profiles
- [ ] Optional native sessions list (requires authenticated API access)
- [ ] WebUI menu shortcuts for files, kanban, and status if needed
- [ ] Instrumentation tests for WebView navigation and intent flows
- [ ] Evaluate a Trusted Web Activity (TWA) variant rendered in real Chrome, gated on Hermes WebUI serving `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` (draft + fingerprint in `twa/`); accept loss of native bridges and HTTPS-only verification before pursuing
- [x] Final package/application ID decision before first public release
- [x] Release signing automation docs and snippets

| DOC-001 | 2026-06-20 | Docs | Cleaned README and created this roadmap as the progress and wishlist tracker |
| BRAND-001 | 2026-06-20 | Branding | Renamed APK output to `hermes-android`; replaced placeholder icon with Hermes WebUI caduceus (vector + density PNGs); icon background aligned to WebUI dark `#1a1a1a` |
| COMPAT-001 | 2026-06-20 | Android compatibility | Guarded share-intent parcelable parsing across pre- and post-Android 13 APIs |
| A-014 | 2026-06-20 | Release | Finalized package ID and namespace as `com.hermeswebui.android` before first public release |
| A-005 | 2026-06-20 | Deep links | Added `hermes://session/{id}` intent filter; navigates WebView to `{serverUrl}/{id}` per WebUI route contract |
| API-001 | 2026-06-20 | API integration | Added `HermesApiClient` probing `/api/status` (public endpoint) on WebView errors to distinguish server-down from content errors |
| NAV-001 | 2026-06-20 | Navigation | Reworked native drawer with WebUI route sections (Chat, Skills, Artifacts, Agents, Scheduler, Messaging); replaced floating button with compact hamburger-in-card trigger |
| NAV-002 | 2026-06-20 | UI integration | Added hamburger-hiding DOM shim + user toggle to avoid visual conflict between native drawer and WebUI menu button; gracefully degrades if WebUI markup changes |
| NAV-003 | 2026-06-20 | Navigation | Removed the temporary native drawer and menu-hiding shim; seeded WebUI's Official Hermes Dashboard config instead of adding a custom Android Terminal button |
| BUG-001 | 2026-06-20 | UI | Fixed unreadable text by applying an explicit native color scheme and disabling WebView algorithmic darkening |
| BUG-002 | 2026-06-20 | WebView | Fixed Hermes WebUI text/content visibility by injecting a measured viewport-height shim when Android WebView computes `100dvh` as `0px` |
| BUG-003 | 2026-06-20 | UI | Added safe-drawing system insets so WebView content and native controls do not overlap status or navigation bars |
| BUG-004 | 2026-06-20 | Navigation | Fixed dashboard redirect/blue-screen recovery by normalizing stored dashboard URLs to their origin, opening dashboard-origin new-window requests in Chrome Custom Tabs, and preventing dashboard pages from becoming app startup state |
| BUG-005 | 2026-06-20 | Permissions | Fixed Android WebView dictation false-denied behavior by normalizing permission-request origins and allowing trusted main-frame fallback for null/opaque origins while still granting audio capture only |
| BUG-006 | 2026-06-20 | Permissions | Added Android `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` permission because WebView Chromium microphone capture on emulator/device can fail device selection without it even when `RECORD_AUDIO` is granted |
| CLEANUP-001 | 2026-06-20 | Cleanup | Removed temporary microphone diagnostic logging/hooks from `MainActivity` after validation and kept only production microphone compatibility handling |
| CLEANUP-002 | 2026-06-20 | Resources | Replaced environment-specific default endpoint strings with placeholder HTTPS origins, removed unused `strings`/`colors` resources, and merged launcher XML resources out of unnecessary `mipmap-anydpi-v26` |
| SEC-001 | 2026-06-20 | Platform | Added Android 12+ `data_extraction_rules` configuration and wired it in `AndroidManifest.xml` while preserving `allowBackup=false` |
| BUILD-002 | 2026-06-20 | Tooling | Upgraded Gradle wrapper to 9.6.0, Kotlin to 2.4.0, AndroidX/Material dependencies to latest stable set, and moved app compile/target SDK to 37; lint now reports no issues |
| REL-001 | 2026-06-20 | Release | Updated Android app version metadata to `0.1.1` and incremented `versionCode` for the `v0.1.1` release |
| BUILD-001 | 2026-06-20 | Tooling | Migrated AGP config to built-in Kotlin, removed legacy compatibility flags, and eliminated obsolete variant API plus dependency-constraints sync warnings |
| PERM-001 | 2026-06-20 | Permissions | Added Android `RECORD_AUDIO` plus an allowlisted WebView audio-capture permission bridge so WebUI microphone input can prompt and grant correctly |
| PERM-002 | 2026-06-20 | Permissions | Added a document-start WebUI microphone fallback flag for the configured Hermes origin so Android WebView skips the unreliable Web Speech API path and uses MediaRecorder/getUserMedia |
| SEC-002 | 2026-06-20 | Security | Relaxed URL policy to allow configured HTTP or HTTPS Hermes hosts while retaining host allowlist checks and non-web scheme blocking |
| UX-001 | 2026-06-20 | Settings | Changed the first-run server URL sample from prefilled text to placeholder text that disappears on focus |
| REL-002 | 2026-06-20 | Release | Renamed app to "Hermes WebUI" (Play Store branding), updated version to `0.1.2`, and built `hermes-android-v0.1.2-pre-release.apk` for GitHub release and device testing |
| NOTIF-001 | 2026-06-21 | Notifications | Added Android-backed WebUI browser notifications with `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, a native channel, a scoped WebView Notification API bridge, service-worker notification fallback, and allowlisted notification tap routing |
| REL-003 | 2026-06-21 | Release | Updated Android app version metadata to `0.1.3-pre-release` with `versionCode` 4 for the next pre-release build |
| REL-004 | 2026-06-21 | Release | Changed distribution artifact staging to use `hermes-webui-v<version>.apk` for GitHub and `hermes-webui-v<version>.aab` for Google Play instead of repository-name filenames |
| A-011 | 2026-06-21 | Release | Added local `keystore.properties` plus GitHub Actions secret-based signing so release APK/AAB builds fail fast unless they are signed and ready for distribution |
| CLEANUP-003 | 2026-06-21 | Build | Moved staged release artifacts from root `release/` into ignored `build/release/` and ignored legacy root release outputs |
| REL-005 | 2026-06-21 | Release | Updated signed release workflow actions to Node 24-compatible majors to avoid GitHub Actions Node 20 deprecation warnings |
| REL-006 | 2026-06-21 | Release | Incremented Android app version to `0.1.4-pre-release` with `versionCode` 5 for the long-press menu fix validation build |
| PERF-001 | 2026-06-21 | WebView | Made WebView and service-worker cache defaults explicit, advertised the real app version in the user agent, and kept rendered content visible during reloads after the first successful page load |
| CLEANUP-004 | 2026-06-21 | Cleanup | Removed stale in-code phase-2 TODOs already tracked in the roadmap, dropped unused Compose test catalog/debug references, and restored `keystore.properties.example` for documented signing setup |
| BUG-007 | 2026-06-21 | WebView | Added a Hermes-origin-scoped touch-and-hold compatibility shim that dispatches `contextmenu` so conversation long-press action menus appear in Android WebView like mobile browsers |
| BUG-008 | 2026-06-21 | WebView | Fixed invisible conversation long-press menus (Issue 6): Android WebView evaluates CSS `100vh` as 0, collapsing the WebUI floating-menu `max-height: calc(100vh - 16px)` to a ~2px sliver. Re-capped `.session-action-menu`/`.workspace-prefs-menu` `max-height` with the measured viewport height in the existing viewport shim. Root-caused via on-device DevTools/CDP inspection after ruling out touch-cancel, z-index, stacking, and opacity; reverted those earlier wrong attempts |
| BUG-009 | 2026-06-22 | WebView | Fixed Issue 7 by removing Android's `/api/dashboard/config` write path and blanking the bundled dashboard default so opening WebUI from Android no longer changes WebUI's Official Hermes Dashboard setting from Auto-detect to Always show |
| REL-007 | 2026-06-22 | Release | Updated Android app version to `0.1.5` with `versionCode` 6; created debug build variant that displays app name as "Hermes DEBUG" to distinguish test builds from official releases; deployed to emulator for testing |
| BUG-010 | 2026-06-22 | Data migration | Fixed Issue 7 persistence: Added app startup migration that clears old dashboard URL from SharedPreferences on upgrade so users updating from pre-0.1.5 versions don't retain the stored dashboard URL that was previously being written to WebUI `/api/dashboard/config`; migration includes versioning for future data schema updates |

## Update rules

- Add only Android-wrapper-specific ideas to [Deferred Android-only ideas](#deferred-android-only-ideas).
- Redirect WebUI layout, styling, animations, routes, API behavior, and product
  workflow requests to Hermes WebUI.
- Track actionable Android-wrapper maintenance in [Maintenance work](#maintenance-work) with an ID, priority,
  status, area, task, and notes.
- Move finished work to [Completed work](#completed-work) after verification.
- Keep `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` aligned when behavior,
  setup, architecture, or workflow changes.
