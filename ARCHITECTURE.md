# Hermes-Android Architecture

## Goals

- Keep Hermes WebUI as primary UX surface for parity and maintainability.
- Treat the official Hermes Dashboard link as a WebUI-owned secondary surface.
- Add native Android affordances around security, integration, and reliability.
- Preserve clean boundaries so native enhancements can scale incrementally.

## Layered design

- `core/`: security policy primitives (URL and navigation decisions)
- `data/`: local encrypted settings, persistence, and Hermes API client
- `domain/`: intent parsing and validation rules
- `ui/`: ViewModel state and Compose screens
- `MainActivity`: Android platform boundary (WebView host, intents, activity contract, Custom Tabs dashboard handoff)

## Runtime flow

1. App starts, loads encrypted WebUI settings and the stored/default dashboard origin URL (`SettingsRepository`).
2. WebView boots with hardened configuration, default HTTP cache behavior, DOM storage, and service-worker cache settings for WebUI-managed assets.
3. The Compose root fills the full window background, then applies `WindowInsets.safeDrawing` around the WebView shell and native snackbar so Android 15 edge-to-edge enforcement does not put content under status or navigation bars.
4. Android WebView compatibility shims stay scoped to Hermes WebUI. Android disables native long-press handling (`isLongClickable = false`, `setOnLongClickListener { true }`) so Hermes WebUI's own touch long-press timer drives its action menus, and re-caps the WebUI floating-menu `max-height` with the measured viewport height because Android WebView evaluates CSS `100vh` as `0` (the same viewport-unit quirk it applies to `100dvh`), which would otherwise collapse the menus to an unreadable sliver. Android also injects a document-start microphone fallback so WebUI voice input uses its MediaRecorder path instead of Web Speech API. The official dashboard is not rendered in an app WebView.
5. On the Hermes WebUI route, Android seeds the WebUI `/api/dashboard/config` origin URL when WebUI has no dashboard URL and Android has one stored/defaulted. Dashboard URLs are normalized to their origin before Android stores or matches them. WebUI then owns rendering and behavior for the Official Hermes Dashboard link in its rail/sidebar.
6. Official Hermes Dashboard links are treated as secondary browser surfaces. Android handles WebView new-window requests and dashboard-origin navigations by launching a Chrome Custom Tab with title/share UI minimized, instead of replacing the primary Hermes WebUI WebView or opening the full default browser UI.
7. Dashboard-origin pages are not saved as the app startup URL. If a dashboard URL is ever the last observed WebView URL, the next launch falls back to the configured Hermes WebUI URL.
8. `UrlPolicy` enforces supported web schemes (`http`/`https`) + domain allowlist for every navigation.
9. WebView microphone permission requests are accepted only for audio capture on trusted Hermes pages. Android prefers explicit allowlisted HTTP/HTTPS origins, normalizes edge-case origin formatting, and allows null/opaque-origin requests only when the active main-frame URL is the configured Hermes WebUI route. Android runtime microphone permission is requested on demand before granting the WebView request.
10. WebUI browser notifications are backed by Android notifications. Android injects a scoped `Notification`/`ServiceWorkerRegistration.showNotification` compatibility facade for the configured Hermes WebUI origin, requests `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` on Android 13+, publishes through a native notification channel, and accepts notification tap routes only when they target an allowlisted Hermes WebUI URL.
11. `MainViewModel` drives loading/error/offline/share UI state. After the first successful page render, reloads and navigations keep the existing WebView content visible so cached pages do not flicker behind a full-screen native loading veil.
12. Share intents are parsed in `domain`, staged in ViewModel, then pushed into WebView flow.
13. Settings updates rewrite encrypted preferences and reload trusted hosts. The Android setup sheet only asks for the Hermes WebUI URL; the dashboard origin is visible and editable in WebUI Settings > System after seeding.
14. On WebView load failure, `MainViewModel` probes `{serverUrl}/api/status` (Hermes WebUI public liveness endpoint) to distinguish "server is down" from a transient content/navigation error. This refines the `isOffline` state and the copy shown to the user in `WebShell`.
15. `hermes://session/{id}` deep links are handled in `MainActivity.onNewIntent`, navigating the WebView to `{serverUrl}/{id}` — the Hermes WebUI session route contract (see `apps/desktop/src/app/routes.ts: sessionRoute()` in hermes-agent).

## Build and release flow

- Local signed release builds load upload-key credentials from an untracked repo-root `keystore.properties` file.
- CI signed release builds load the same values from `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*` environment variables, with the keystore file decoded from the `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` GitHub Actions secret.
- The signed release workflow uses Node 24-compatible GitHub Actions majors to avoid deprecated Node 20 runner execution.
- `:app:assembleRelease`, `:app:bundleRelease`, and `:app:stageReleaseArtifacts` fail fast when signing credentials are missing or the keystore file path is invalid, preventing unsigned distribution artifacts from being staged as release-ready output.
- `:app:stageReleaseArtifacts` copies signed APK/AAB distribution files into the ignored root `build/release/` output folder so generated binaries do not live beside source files.

## Security model

- Trust boundary is the configured Hermes WebUI and dashboard URL host set.
- In-app navigation remains inside trust boundary only.
- Everything else is blocked or externalized.
- The official dashboard is browser-rendered through Custom Tabs so Chrome handles dashboard compatibility, cookies, transport behavior, and same-origin navigation.
- Microphone access requires Android `RECORD_AUDIO` plus `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` and a trusted WebView context (allowlisted origin, with a null/opaque-origin fallback only while the active main frame is the configured Hermes WebUI route). Android grants only `RESOURCE_AUDIO_CAPTURE`; camera/video capture remains denied. Android also seeds WebUI's `mic_force_mediarecorder` localStorage flag at document start for the configured WebUI origin only, avoiding Web Speech API false-denied errors in Android WebView.
- Hermes WebUI drives its own conversation long-press menus from a touch timer (e.g. `static/sessions.js`, ~400ms). Android only disables the native long-press path (`isLongClickable = false`, `setOnLongClickListener { true }`) so that timer is not preempted; it does not synthesize `contextmenu` or interfere with touch events. The menus themselves are positioned `fixed` and capped with `max-height: calc(100vh - 16px)`; because Android WebView evaluates CSS `100vh` as `0`, that cap collapses the menu to a ~2px sliver. The viewport shim therefore re-caps `.session-action-menu`/`.workspace-prefs-menu` `max-height` to the measured viewport height (recomputed on resize/orientation change), restoring full-size, scrollable menus with their native entrance animation intact.
- Browser notification access requires Android app notification permission and a trusted WebView context. The bridge uses AndroidX WebMessageListener rather than a secret-bearing JavaScript interface, rejects subframes and non-WebUI origins, limits payload handling to notification title/body/tag/target URL, and validates notification tap URLs against the same allowlist before loading them.
- Android cleartext traffic is permitted so configured HTTP deployments can load. App-level URL policy still limits trusted in-app navigation and downloads to the configured host allowlist.
- WebView uses browser-managed HTTP and service-worker cache semantics. Android does not maintain a separate stale copy of Hermes WebUI HTML or authenticated API responses.
- Sensitive app-side config is encrypted with Android Keystore-backed keys.

## Extensibility points

- Add more deep-link hosts/paths in the `hermes://` scheme (see `AndroidManifest.xml` + `handleDeepLink` in `MainActivity`).
- Add FCM push notification handlers that map server-originated events to allowlisted Hermes URLs/session IDs.
- Add biometric gate before `WebShell` composable rendering.
- Add advanced native settings in `ui/settings` + `data/SettingsRepository`.
- Prefer WebUI-owned navigation/settings for dashboard links; open the official dashboard through Custom Tabs rather than an app-owned dashboard WebView unless there is a tested reason to revisit the WebView path.
- Extend `HermesApiClient` with authenticated calls (e.g. `/api/sessions`) once an API key storage strategy is decided.
