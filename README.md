# Hermes-Android 🤖📱

Hermes-Android is the native Android wrapper for
[Hermes Web UI](https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui). It keeps the
Hermes web app as the primary interface and adds only the Android pieces that
should live on-device: secure WebView hosting, native navigation, sharing,
downloads, notifications, and encrypted local settings.

> 🔒 HTTP/HTTPS URL policy · 🌐 host allowlist · 📂 sharing + downloads · 🧊 encrypted settings
> 🔔 Android-backed WebUI notifications

The app is intentionally thin. Hermes product behavior, UI layout, styling, and
feature workflows stay server-delivered through WebUI, while this repo owns
Android integration and device safety.

## Repository Scope

Use this repository for Android-wrapper issues and PRs only:

- WebView hosting, navigation, compatibility, and Android lifecycle behavior
- Android permissions, microphone, notifications, sharing, uploads, downloads, and deep links
- Local encrypted settings, app identity, build, signing, and Play distribution

Open WebUI/product issues in
[Hermes Web UI](https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui) instead:

- Hermes UI layout, styling, animations, routing, and dashboard behavior
- Chat/session behavior, product features, API behavior, and WebUI bugs
- Feature requests that should work the same in browser, desktop, and Android

## ✨ Features

### 🧩 Native shell

- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose Android app
- Hardened WebView for Hermes WebUI
- Android WebView compatibility fixes for Hermes WebUI viewport rendering
- Android WebView compatibility shim that re-caps Hermes WebUI floating/long-press menu height and the generated update summary panel so they render full-size instead of collapsing (Android WebView treats CSS `vh` units as `0` here) while preserving vertical page scrolling for expandable content
- Default WebView HTTP/service-worker caching with smoother reload rendering
- System-bar inset handling so WebView content and native controls avoid status and navigation bars
- Android WebView microphone compatibility that forces WebUI voice input through its MediaRecorder path
- WebUI-owned navigation for the Official Hermes Dashboard setting
- Explicitly configured Official Hermes Dashboard links open in a Chrome Custom Tab with minimal browser UI
- Deep link support: `hermes://session/{id}` navigates to Hermes sessions
- Cold-start restore keeps the active Hermes session/workspace route when the app process is restarted, with a WebUI-origin-scoped workspace-button recovery fallback that reloads the last known in-app session route if the panel is tapped from a blank root state
- Short app switches now preserve the current WebView and briefly favor silent reconnect over immediately replacing the page with the native error screen; if Hermes does not recover before the grace window expires, the normal error UI appears promptly instead of waiting for a later retry probe
- If a reconnect attempt is already in progress when the app backgrounds, Android now keeps that bounded retry alive briefly with a foreground "Hermes is running in the background" notification instead of canceling immediately on `onStop`
- Server health probing on WebView errors to distinguish server-down from content errors
- First-run settings flow for the Hermes WebUI URL; the dashboard URL is managed only by WebUI Settings > System
- Back handling, pull-to-refresh, loading, offline, and error states, including direct server-URL recovery from the native error screen

### 🔌 Android integration

- File upload and download support
- Share-to-app intake for text and files
- Microphone capture support for trusted Hermes WebUI pages
- Android-backed browser notifications for Hermes WebUI completion alerts
- Optional troubleshooting debug-log capture with a persistent foreground notification and one-tap Stop action
- Cookie-backed WebView session persistence
- Encrypted local settings storage
- Native app identity, launcher icon, splash, and settings surface

### 🛡️ Security

- HTTP/HTTPS URL validation
- Host allowlist for in-app navigation
- External browser handoff for non-allowlisted HTTP/HTTPS links
- WebView microphone grants are limited to trusted Hermes WebUI pages and audio capture only (with Android `RECORD_AUDIO` + `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` permissions)
- Android seeds WebUI's MediaRecorder microphone fallback for the configured Hermes origin only
- WebUI notification grants and delivery are scoped to the configured Hermes origin, require Android notification permission when applicable, and route taps only to allowlisted Hermes WebUI URLs
- Cleartext traffic permitted so configured HTTP deployments can load; HTTPS remains recommended outside trusted local networks
- Hardened WebView defaults and SSL-error cancellation

<a id="configuration"></a>
## ⚙️ Configuration

Default endpoints live in:

- `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`

Important values:

- `default_server_url` - default Hermes WebUI URL
- `default_dashboard_url` - optional local Official Hermes Dashboard origin used only for Android-side Custom Tab matching when explicitly configured; leave blank so WebUI owns auto-detect and persistence
- `app_name` - Android launcher label

The shipped WebUI default is a placeholder HTTPS origin and the shipped dashboard default is blank. Configure your real Hermes WebUI URL in app settings on first run; both `http://` and `https://` URLs are accepted.

Android identity lives in:

- `app/build.gradle.kts` - `namespace` and `applicationId`
- `settings.gradle.kts` - Gradle project name
- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - launcher, permissions, intent filters

Release signing is wired for both local builds and GitHub Actions without
committing secrets.

### Local signed release setup

1. Copy `keystore.properties.example` to `keystore.properties`.
2. Fill in your real keystore path and passwords.
3. Keep `keystore.properties` untracked.

Example `keystore.properties` values:

```properties
storeFile=C:/path/to/upload-keystore.jks
storePassword=replace-me
keyAlias=upload
keyPassword=replace-me
```

With that file present, release APK builds automatically sign the output.

```powershell
Copy-Item .\keystore.properties.example .\keystore.properties
.\gradlew.bat :app:stageGithubReleaseApk --no-daemon
```

If signing values are missing, `release` tasks fail fast with a clear message
instead of producing unsigned distribution artifacts.

### GitHub Actions signed release setup

Add these repository secrets before running the release workflow:

- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_BASE64`

To create the Base64 keystore value on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("C:/path/to/upload-keystore.jks")) | Set-Clipboard
```

The workflow in `.github/workflows/1-orchestration-release.yml` can then:

- build and sign one GitHub release APK with application ID `com.hermeswebui.android.github`
- build and sign one Play release AAB with application ID `com.hermeswebui.android`
- upload both files as workflow artifacts
- fan out to separate GitHub and Play publishing jobs after the build succeeds
- create or update a GitHub Release using the Gradle Android `versionName`
- attach only the GitHub APK to the GitHub Release
- upload only the Play AAB to the Google Play internal testing track
- include a GitHub Release body with explicit build details (version/tag, commit SHA, APK filename, SHA-256, workflow run URL) plus generated GitHub notes
- include a Play Store `en-US` What's New changelog generated from the same GitHub release notes
- fail a tag release when the tag, such as `v0.1.8`, does not match the Android `versionName`
- keep release notes scoped to app/runtime changes in that release (exclude workflow-only and docs-only updates)

The publish steps live in reusable/manual repair workflows:

- `.github/workflows/2-publish-github-apk.yml` publishes the APK artifact to GitHub Releases.
- `.github/workflows/3-publish-play-store-release.yml` uploads the AAB artifact to Google Play internal testing.

If either publish target fails after the build artifact upload succeeds, rerun
only the failed publish workflow manually with the build run ID, artifact name,
version name, and commit SHA shown in the failed release run.

See [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md) for the release operator checklist.

Google Play listing assets:

- `play-store/icon-512.png` - 512x512 high-res app icon for Play Console store listing (opaque PNG)
- `play-store/icon-512.svg` - editable vector source used for Play listing export
- `tools/generate_play_store_icon.py` - regenerates both files from the launcher vector geometry
- `tools/requirements-play-icon.txt` - Python dependency list for icon generation script

Release artifact naming:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:stageGithubReleaseApk --no-daemon
```

When signing is configured, this stages the signed GitHub distribution APK under
Gradle's ignored build output directory with the product name, version, and
release channel:

- `build/release/hermes-webui-v<version>-github.apk` - GitHub/device APK artifact
- `build/release/hermes-webui-v<version>.aab` - Play internal testing upload artifact

The GitHub APK is a separate Android app variant: it installs as
`com.hermeswebui.android.github`, displays as "Hermes WebUI GitHub", and reports
`<version>-github` from inside the app. The Play AAB keeps the official
`com.hermeswebui.android` application ID and plain `<version>` version name, so
both channels can be installed on the same device at the same time.

Before each release, increment both `appVersionName` and `versionCode` in
`app/build.gradle.kts`. Manual workflow runs create or update `v<versionName>`
automatically; tag-triggered runs must use the matching tag, for example
`v0.1.8`.
