# Hermes-Android 🤖📱

Hermes-Android is the native Android wrapper for
[Hermes Web UI](https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui). It keeps the
Hermes web app as the primary interface and adds only the Android pieces that
should live on-device: secure WebView hosting, native navigation, sharing,
downloads, notifications, and encrypted local settings.

> 🔒 HTTP/HTTPS URL policy · 🌐 host allowlist · 📂 sharing + downloads · 🧊 encrypted settings
> 🔔 Android-backed WebUI notifications

The app is intentionally thin. Hermes product behavior, UI layout, styling, and
feature workflows stay server-delivered through WebUI, while this repo owns
Android integration and device safety.

## Repository Scope

Use this repository for Android-wrapper issues and PRs only:

- WebView hosting, navigation, compatibility, and Android lifecycle behavior
- Android permissions, microphone, notifications, sharing, uploads, downloads, and deep links
- Local encrypted settings, app identity, build, signing, and Play distribution

Open WebUI/product issues in
[Hermes Web UI](https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui) instead:

- Hermes UI layout, styling, animations, routing, and dashboard behavior
- Chat/session behavior, product features, API behavior, and WebUI bugs
- Feature requests that should work the same in browser, desktop, and Android

## 🧪 Looking for Internal Testers!

We're looking for internal testers for the first pre-release build on Google Play.

To get added, **message [@Paladin173](https://github.com/Paladin173) your Gmail address** and we'll send you a Play Store invite.

Once added, the app will appear in the Play Store for you to install and receive automatic updates.

Current pre-release version: `v0.1.5`.

Current Android build metadata:

- Version name: `0.1.5`
- Version code: `6`
- Application ID: `com.hermeswebui.android`
- Compile/target SDK: `37`

> Requires a running [Hermes WebUI](https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui) instance. Enter your server URL on first launch.

## ✨ Features

### 🧩 Native shell

- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose Android app
- Hardened WebView for Hermes WebUI
- Android WebView compatibility fixes for Hermes WebUI viewport rendering
- Android WebView compatibility shim that re-caps Hermes WebUI floating/long-press menu height so conversation action menus render full-size instead of collapsing (Android WebView treats CSS `100vh` as `0`)
- Default WebView HTTP/service-worker caching with smoother reload rendering
- System-bar inset handling so WebView content and native controls avoid status and navigation bars
- Android WebView microphone compatibility that forces WebUI voice input through its MediaRecorder path
- WebUI-owned navigation for the Official Hermes Dashboard setting
- Explicitly configured Official Hermes Dashboard links open in a Chrome Custom Tab with minimal browser UI
- Deep link support: `hermes://session/{id}` navigates to Hermes sessions
- Server health probing on WebView errors to distinguish server-down from content errors
- First-run settings flow for the Hermes WebUI URL; the dashboard URL is managed only by WebUI Settings > System
- Back handling, pull-to-refresh, loading, offline, and error states

### 🔌 Android integration

- File upload and download support
- Share-to-app intake for text and files
- Microphone capture support for trusted Hermes WebUI pages
- Android-backed browser notifications for Hermes WebUI completion alerts
- Cookie-backed WebView session persistence
- Encrypted local settings storage
- Native app identity, launcher icon, splash, and settings surface

### 🛡️ Security

- HTTP/HTTPS URL validation
- Host allowlist for in-app navigation
- External browser handoff for non-allowlisted HTTP/HTTPS links
- WebView microphone grants are limited to trusted Hermes WebUI pages and audio capture only (with Android `RECORD_AUDIO` + `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` permissions)
- Android seeds WebUI's MediaRecorder microphone fallback for the configured Hermes origin only
- WebUI notification grants and delivery are scoped to the configured Hermes origin, require Android notification permission when applicable, and route taps only to allowlisted Hermes WebUI URLs
- Cleartext traffic permitted so configured HTTP deployments can load; HTTPS remains recommended outside trusted local networks
- Hardened WebView defaults and SSL-error cancellation

## ⚙️ Configuration

Default endpoints live in:

- `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`

Important values:

- `default_server_url` - default Hermes WebUI URL
- `default_dashboard_url` - optional local Official Hermes Dashboard origin used only for Android-side Custom Tab matching when explicitly configured; leave blank so WebUI owns auto-detect and persistence
- `app_name` - Android launcher label

The shipped WebUI default is a placeholder HTTPS origin and the shipped dashboard default is blank. Configure your real Hermes WebUI URL in app settings on first run; both `http://` and `https://` URLs are accepted.

Android identity lives in:

- `app/build.gradle.kts` - `namespace` and `applicationId`
- `settings.gradle.kts` - Gradle project name
- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - launcher, permissions, intent filters

Release signing is wired for both local builds and GitHub Actions without
committing secrets.

### Local signed release setup

1. Copy `keystore.properties.example` to `keystore.properties`.
2. Fill in your real keystore path and passwords.
3. Keep `keystore.properties` untracked.

Example `keystore.properties` values:

```properties
storeFile=C:/path/to/upload-keystore.jks
storePassword=replace-me
keyAlias=upload
keyPassword=replace-me
```

With that file present, release builds automatically sign the APK and AAB.

```powershell
Copy-Item .\keystore.properties.example .\keystore.properties
.\gradlew.bat :app:stageReleaseArtifacts --no-daemon
```

If signing values are missing, `release` tasks fail fast with a clear message
instead of producing unsigned distribution artifacts.

### GitHub Actions signed release setup

Add these repository secrets before running the release workflow:

- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`

To create the Base64 keystore value on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("C:/path/to/upload-keystore.jks")) | Set-Clipboard
```

The workflow in `.github/workflows/release.yml` can then:

- build and sign release APK/AAB artifacts
- upload them as workflow artifacts on manual runs
- attach them to a GitHub Release automatically when you push a `v*` tag
- upload the AAB to the Google Play internal track when `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_BASE64` is configured

Google Play listing assets:

- `play-store/icon-512.png` - 512x512 high-res app icon for Play Console store listing (opaque PNG)
- `play-store/icon-512.svg` - editable vector source used for Play listing export
- `tools/generate_play_store_icon.py` - regenerates both files from the launcher vector geometry
- `tools/requirements-play-icon.txt` - Python dependency list for icon generation script

Release artifact naming:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:stageReleaseArtifacts --no-daemon
```

When signing is configured, this stages signed distribution files under
Gradle's ignored build output directory with the product name and version:

- `build/release/hermes-webui-v<version>.apk` - GitHub/device APK artifact
- `build/release/hermes-webui-v<version>.aab` - Google Play app bundle artifact
